This is a part of the vbap implementation from 
Ville Pulkki <Ville.Pulkki@hut.fi>

Other parts of the code are folded into the "vbap" external.

An example how to create a vbap file used by the "vabp" external:

first type make to generate the "define_loudspeaker" program.

write down the description of your loudspeaker positions, similar to
the file

loudspeaker_directions_3D

then call 

./define_loudspeaker loudspeaker_directrions_3D > ls_setup 

lsi_setup can be used with the "vbap" object to spatialize the data.
